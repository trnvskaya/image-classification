# Machine Learning Projects

**This was developed as part of the Machine Learning 2 course at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague (FIT ČVUT).**

This repository contains two projects:

## **1. Image Classification & Dimensionality Reduction**

**Description:**
In this project, I explore multiple models for classifying the same image dataset. I compared SVM, Naive Bayes, and LDA classifiers, tune hyperparameters, test normalization methods, and applied dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and LLE) to improve performance.

**Key Steps:**

* Data splitting for training and testing
* Model training with hyperparameter tuning (including different SVM kernels)
* Experiment with data normalization
* Apply PCA and LLE to find optimal dimensions
* Compare results, choose the best performing model and estimate final model performance on unseen images



## **2. Neural Network Image Classification**

**Description:**
In this project, I built and trained a neural network in PyTorch to classify images from the same dataset. I preprocessed and normalized the data, split it into training, validation, and test sets, and evaluated the network’s performance in predicting image labels.
**Key Steps:**

* Load and normalize image data for training
* Split data into training, validation, and test sets
* Build and train 2 types of neural networks to classify images (FNN and CNN)
* Choose a better perofrming model and evaluate model accuracy on unseen data
